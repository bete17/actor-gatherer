"""Answering, from the page, what a harness asks in its terminal (data.py's `asking`): the keys that answer its dialog,
and what it then tells its model, to check the answer by -- each harness's own (harness_kit's `answer_keys`,
`answer_expected`, `answer_summary`, where its dialogs are described), for the harness the question names (its
`harness`; Claude Code's when it names none).

    keys(ask, choice)       the keys to type, one at a time, into the dialog as it first shows
    expected(ask, choice)   what the harness records once it has the answer: each a string it holds
    summary(ask, choice)    the answer in a line, for the page
    recorded(result, expect)  whether what the harness recorded holds what was expected

A QUESTION is answered with `choice` {"answers": [one per question: {"options": [the picked options' places, from 0],
"text": the reader's own answer, or None}]}; a PLAN with {"plan": "auto" | "manual" | "change" (Claude Code's),
"implement" | "change" (codex's), "text": what to change}; a PERMISSION (a tool it asks to run) with {"allow": bool,
"text": why not, or None} -- its harness's `permission_keys`.

The keys answer a dialog no one has touched yet; the server types them only into a terminal nothing was typed into
since the question was asked (sessions.py's `answer`).
