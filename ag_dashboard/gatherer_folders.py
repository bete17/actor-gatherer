"""The folders the reader keeps GATHERERS in, above them in the list: only to organise it. Kept in the dashboard's own
database (<home>/dashboard.db, beside folders.py's), so every dashboard on this home shows the same ones. A gatherer in
one is the same gatherer: its actors, what they share, its name, its hiding (hiding.py) are as they were. With none, the
list is as it was without them: every gatherer at its top.

Apart from folders.py's, which keep a gatherer's ACTORS (the gatherer their top): those are a gatherer's own, these the
home's, holding gatherers -- and nothing else: no actor is filed in one, none is started in one, none is counted on one.

Table `gatherer_folders`, one row per folder, kept until it is deleted, empty or not:

    id          its number (never used again)
    parent      the folder it is in; NULL: the list's top
    name        unique among the folders beside it, whatever its case; never holding "/" (folders.py's rule)
    at          when it was made (ISO, UTC)

Table `gatherers_filed`, one row per gatherer in a folder (none: at the list's top):

    gatherer    its name (the reader's title for it, titles.py, is apart: renamed so, it stays where it is)
    folder      the folder's id
    at          when it was put there

A folder deleted, what was in it -- gatherers and folders -- moves up into the one it was in."""
