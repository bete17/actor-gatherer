"""TASKS: what the reader works with at once -- actors and apps alike, its ITEMS -- one row in the list, opened as one
layout (the page's TASKS, 05-agent-list.js and 07-panes.js). An item is an actor, by its channel, or an app's instance,
by "app:<its id>" (`app_item`); each is in one task at most, and one in none is a task of its own, needing no row here.
A task is a LEAF: it holds items, not folders; where it is in the list's tree is where its actors are filed
(folders.py), each actor put in one joining it filed where the task is. Within a task every agent is attached to every
app (task_links.py: joining one attaches, leaving it detaches). Kept in the dashboard's own database
(<home>/dashboard.db, beside folders.py's tables), so every dashboard on this home shows the same ones.

Table `tasks`, one row per task:

    id          its number (never used again)
    gatherer    the gatherer its actors are of
    name        what the list calls it -- "": named by what is in it (the page's: its lead actor's name, else its app's)
    at          when it was made (ISO, UTC)

Table `tasked`, one row per item in a task:

    gatherer, channel   the item: an actor by the channel it was put in as -- its own, or the id the dashboard started
                        it under (a Codex session's, before its thread's id comes with its first turn); the page finds
                        it by either, as it finds folders.py's `filed` -- or an app's instance, "app:<its id>"
    task                the task's id
    at                  when it was put in it

Table `tasks_grouped`, one row per gatherer whose items sharing an app were made one task, once (`group`): what was
kept before apps were items.

`add` puts items in the task another item is in -- one in none, a task made of them all; `take_out` takes them out. A
task left with one item, or none, is gone: its last item a task of its own again."""
