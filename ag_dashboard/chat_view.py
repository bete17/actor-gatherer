"""Chat's view of an actor's conversation (CHAT_VIEW.md): what Chat draws, made from one read of the gatherer at one
moment, so its parts never disagree.

    view(conn, channel, session=None, now=None) -> {
      turns:      files.py's turns, each with `began` (when its message was sent) and `cid` (the send from Chat it is,
                  if one is: `send_id`), and each message written while it ran (`more`) with its `cid` too
      opening:    a turn sent and not stored yet -- {text, cid, began, seen} (`seen`: the harness's record has it) --
                  or None
      current:    {state, turn, doing, failing, asking}: the latest turn's state -- opening, working, asking, done,
                  stopped (`stopped`: how) or idle (no turn) -- and `turn` its n ("opening" for the opening)
      waiting:    what waits for the agent's next step: [{text, cid, how}] -- "queued" in the harness, held for its
                  turn's end; "chat", sent from Chat while it worked, not yet in its record; "dashboard", in the
                  dashboard's own queue for its terminal
      taken_back: the message Esc took back before any of its answer came (data.py's `taken_back`), {text, cid, at}
      version:    what changed it: the same version, the same view
    }

The state follows what the conversation and the harness's record say, in order (`_state`): a turn is at work from its
message on; it is over when its answer ends it (data.py's `turn_over`) -- unless the harness holds a message for its end,
which it goes on with; stopped when Esc or an error stopped it (its record, or a hang-up after its words came), or its
session's process ended while it ran (the session's `ended`, later than the turn began); asking
while it waits on the user. No time decides a state but a send not seen for UNSEEN_SECONDS.

A send from Chat is linked to the message it became once, in order (`_links`): the stored message of its words after
it -- or, a message taken back (Esc) and sent again, the send after the take-back, ag restoring the old row at its old
time. Its id is the send's (`send_id`) until sends carry one of their own (CHAT_VIEW.md, step 3).
