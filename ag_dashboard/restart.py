"""`ag dashboard restart [--host H] [--port N] [--open]`: the home's dashboard stopped and started again, so that it runs
the code now on disk (after a pull). `ag stop` leaves the dashboard alone: it stops what ag's launchers started, the hook
servers, which come back by themselves at the next call; a dashboard does not, and stopping it closes every terminal it
runs.

Which dashboard: the one the home's address file names (home.address_path, written as each dashboard starts), and only
once its process runs and its page says it serves this home -- never a process only the file names, whose pid may since
be another program's. With none running, one is started.

The stop is the one Ctrl-C makes (SIGTERM), which closes every terminal the dashboard runs: its actors' harnesses, and
this command's own when it runs in one of them. So the stop and the start are done by a process of their own
(`python -m ag_dashboard.restart --worker ...`, in a session of its own, writing to LOG), which outlives that terminal;
the command waits for it and says what it did, if it is still there to say it.

The new dashboard listens where the old one did (--host / --port: elsewhere) and starts in its working directory, where
new actors start. Its environment is the caller's less what ties it to an actor (as sessions.agent_env makes an actor's,
less ag's own AG_ACTOR / AG_DASHBOARD): an actor's shell is a usual place to run this from. It is started as the ag app
starts one, detached, its output added to LOG. Its actors are listed as they were, each to open again; an open page or
the app reconnects by itself, but a page keeps the script it loaded until it is reloaded."""
