"""What the main routes return, as Pydantic models: the home (/api/home), one actor (/api/agent), its transcript,
history and files. They describe the JSON for FastAPI's schema (each route's `response_model`) and are checked against
real answers in the tests (test_dashboard_app.py: each validates, and gives back exactly what it was given); the routes
do not serialize through them -- they send the JSON json.dumps writes, as the page has always read it.

Every field may be left out (an answer's {error} when its gatherer has no database, its fields then absent), and a
field not named here is kept (`extra="allow"`): the models say what the page reads, not all there is."""
