"""The host's files shared live, as an app whose manifest asks `docs` is given them (Host.docs(); DESIGN.md, "The
host's shared files"): each file open is one document (a CRDT's, Yjs's) that every page editing it holds a copy of,
the file on disk one more of its editors -- what an actor or anything else writes to it merged in as it lands, three
ways, around what the pages typed and did not save; the lines the pages edited since the file was opened (its conflict
zone) asked about, not merged into. The actors working on branches of their own have their changes merged into the
same documents (held for the user where they say so), and what an actor changed of a file lately can be read. One
copy of each, whichever app shows it: two apps (or two pages) with a file open edit the same document.

Only an app run in the host's own process is given it (an app in its own process: AppError), and only one whose
manifest asks it (`[capabilities] docs = true`). Paths are absolute, each under the `root` it is asked with (the
folder a panel shows): one outside it is refused. Every method raises AppError for what it refuses: the file is not
text, is too large, has changed meanwhile, ...

    an actor's      view(path, root, channel) -> text; put(path, root, seen, wanted, by, how): an actor's change put

                    are editing held for them; or "propose", each change held for them to accept or reject (accepted,
                    written to the file) -- `view` then the text with that actor's proposals in
