"""What an app's backend is, and what the host gives it (DESIGN.md, "An app is a manifest, a backend and a panel").

    App         what an app's backend subclasses: open and close instances, answer tool calls and its panel's own
                requests, hear of agents attached, do its scheduled work. Every method has a default (`call`'s
                refuses every tool)
    Host        what the host gives an app: insert and read events, the agents of an instance, a message to its
                panels, the app's own folder, a notification to the user, a message to one of its agents and an
                agent of its own started
    Instance    one opened copy of an app: the host makes its id; the app may set its title and data
    Caller      who made a tool call: an agent (its channel), or the user through the panel
    ToolResult  a tool call's answer, as MCP's `tools/call` gives one
    Response    the answer to a request the panel made of the backend (its own routes)
    AppError    a refusal: the tool call answers it as an error, a request with its status

An app in the host's process is one of these directly; an app in its own process is reached through remote.py, which
gives each side the other as these same classes. An app's pollers are not here: ag builds them in its own process from
the manifest's [[pollers]] (manifest.Poller). Standard library only."""
