// The page's streams, each as an EventSource would be, but all of a page's over one WebSocket (ag_dashboard/api/ws.py
// says why and how): a browser keeps at most six connections to the dashboard open, for all its tabs together, and an
// EventSource holds one for as long as it is open -- two tabs, or one with a terminal, an Editor and a Preview, held
// them all, and every other request waited for one to close. A WebSocket is not one of the six.
//
// `stream(url)` is what `new EventSource(url)` was: the same events (`addEventListener(name)`, `onopen`, `onerror`,
// `onmessage`), `readyState`, `close()`, and tried again as an EventSource is -- after a stream ends, and once the
// socket is back after it went (the server restarted). A page whose socket never worked (a dashboard without WebSockets)
// opens each stream as an EventSource after all.
