// and the earlier behind a + (a − folds them again); its latest call while nothing followed it; the line under it while
// it runs, or how it stopped; what waits to reach the agent. A button at its message, or ⌘+click on it, shows its files
// and commands at the left. Before the latest, its replies are shown or folded as the setting "Chat's earlier turns" has
// them, a click on its message the other way.
